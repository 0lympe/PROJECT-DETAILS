fiverr takes 20% so I can't do the work with 60 euro in fiverr. 
but I can do one thing. fiverr will also charge you almost 10 euro. 
so if you can make the project 70 euro and send me the money outside fiverr. say a bank account. then they will not charge you . and I will get what I am 
working. I will give you my europian bank account so you can pay easily
If it is okay you can contact me in email or whats app. 

and please don't talk about it in fiverr as they might create issue
